# RITS Metal Craft - Project Documentation

Welcome to the **RITS Metal Craft** website project! This document completely explains the project structure, what technologies are used, and how everything is organized so that it is easily understandable for anyone

## 🏢 Project Overview 
This is a modern, responsive, and fast web application built for **RITS Metal Craft**, a leading metal fabrication company in Trichy. The website showcases their metal fabrication services, products, past projects, and provides a way for customers to contact them.

## 💻 Tech Stack 
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18
- **Build Tool:** Vite (For extremely fast development and building)
- **Language:** TypeScript (Adds strict typing to JavaScript for better code quality)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (For utility-first, highly customizable, and responsive design)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (Used for smooth page transitions and interactive elements)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM (Handles navigation between different pages smoothly without reloading)
- **SEO & Meta Tags:** React Helmet Async (Optimizes the site for search engines like Google)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (Clean and modern SVG icons)

## 📂 Folder Structure 

The core of the application lives inside the `/src` folder:

```text
src/
├── assets/          # Contains images, logos, and static files.
├── components/      # Reusable UI parts (Buttons, Navbar, Footer, etc.)
├── config/          # Global configuration settings if any.
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks used across the app.
├── lib/             # Utility functions.
├── pages/           # Represents the individual web pages (Home, About, Contact).
│   └── services/    # Individual detail pages for specific services.
├── styles/          # Additional global styling files.
├── App.tsx          # The main layout and routing file.
├── index.css        # The main Tailwind CSS entry point.
└── main.tsx         # The root file where React mounts to the HTML.
```

## 🧩 Components Details 
Components are reusable blocks of code. Here are the key ones:
- **`Navbar.tsx` & `Footer.tsx`**: The top navigation bar and bottom footer, visible on all pages.
- **`FloatingSocialMenu.tsx`**: A sticky/floating menu mostly used to show quick contact options like WhatsApp.
- **`PremiumServiceCards`**: Custom designed, animated cards used to beautifully display the services.
- **`ProcessSection.tsx`**: Explains the step-by-step working process of the company.
- **`SEO.tsx`**: A unified component for handling SEO properties on different pages to rank well on Google.

## 📄 Pages
All the routes go to these specific page files:
- **`Index.tsx`**: The Home Page (Landing page with video/hero section, service overview).
- **`About.tsx`**: Details about the company, its history, and mission.
- **`Products.tsx`**: Showcases the specific products they manufacture.
- **`Services.tsx`**: Lists all the different metal fabrication services.
- **`Projects.tsx`**: A gallery or list of completed projects to build trust.
- **`Contact.tsx`**: Contact forms, maps, and direct contact details.
- **Service Details (`/services/*`)**: Deep dive pages for Elevation Work, Aluminium Partition, Aluminium Windows, Steel Fabrication, SS Works, MS Works, General Fabrication, and Roofing Work.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project 

Since this uses `Vite` and `npm`, running it locally is very simple:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run this command in the terminal inside the project folder to install everything needed.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   This will start the local server.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production:**
   When you are ready to upload the website to a live server.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## ⚙️ Key Concepts 
- **Lazy Loading:** `React.lazy()` is used in `App.tsx` for importing pages. This means the browser only loads code for a page when the user specifically goes to that page. This makes the initial website load **extremely fast**.
- **Scroll to Top:** A small component in `App.tsx` ensures that whenever you navigate to a new page, the scroll bar resets to the top automatically.
- **Suspense:** Shows a loading spinner (loader) while the lazy-loaded pages are fetching.

*If you need to make changes, look primarily in the `src/pages` and `src/components` folders. Tailwind classes handle all the design directly in the `.tsx` files.*
